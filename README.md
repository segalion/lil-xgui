# lil-xgui
An ultralightweight wrapper for [lil-gui](https://github.com/georgealways/lil-gui) that extends its functionality without modifying it. 

lil-xgui follows the same philosophy: minimal, powerful, and efficient.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Icons in controllers and folders** with `.icon(iconName)` access to >200.000 open source vector icons by its name.
- **Multi-control rows** with `.append()` instead of `.add()` can create compact UIs.
- **Extend controllers to all standard html input types** ("password","date","datetime-local","color","checkbox","number","range","radio","file","tel","url","week","search","month","email","submit","hidden","button" and "image")
- **Custom context menus** (floating gui to deploy contextmenus).
- **Accordion Mode**: Expands only one folder branch at a time for cleaner UI.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search and highlight elements while keeping context.

## ðŸš€ Installation
